# Week 2 – Alerting, Classification, and Incident Response

This week builds on your mini‑SOC lab and focuses on three main pillars:

- Alert priority levels (CVSS, impact/likelihood, business context)
- Incident classification and enrichment (MITRE ATT&CK, ENISA, VERIS)
- Basic incident response lifecycle and documentation (NIST SP 800‑61)

All deliverables for this week are organized into subfolders.
