On 18 August 2025, a controlled security exercise was conducted against a vulnerable
FTP service in our lab to test our detection and response processes. 
  The simulated attacker successfully exploited an outdated service and gained command-line access.
  Our monitoring tools recorded the activity, and the system was quickly contained and reset. 
  No production systems or real data were involved. 
  This exercise confirms that similar vulnerabilities in production could lead to compromise if 
not patched. The main recommendations are to remove or update outdated services, strengthen
  monitoring rules, and continue regular security testing.
